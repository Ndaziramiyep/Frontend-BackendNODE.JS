# userAuth system 

demonstrating how to handle user login, active session management, and logout using Express and a SQL database (e.g., MySQL). This example assumes you have basic knowledge of Node.js, Express, and SQL.

Login: User submits credentials via a form. The server checks the credentials against the database and starts a session if successful.

Active Session Management: Authenticated routes (e.g., dashboard) are protected by middleware that checks for an active session.

Logout: Session is destroyed, logging the user out and redirecting them to the login page.
This setup covers the basics of user login, session management, and logout using Node.js, Express, and MySQL.
